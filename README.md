# Healthcare Financing Platform

## Description

The Healthcare Financing Platform is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables patients to create funding requests for their medical expenses and allows donors to contribute directly to healthcare costs. This platform eliminates intermediaries and ensures transparent, secure, and efficient healthcare crowdfunding.

The smart contract consists of two core functions:
- **Create Healthcare Request**: Patients can create funding requests with their medical condition details and target funding amount
- **Donate to Healthcare**: Donors can contribute AptosCoin directly to patients' healthcare funding requests

Each funding request includes patient information, medical condition description, funding goals, and real-time tracking of donations received. The system automatically deactivates funding once the target amount is reached.

## Vision

Our vision is to democratize healthcare financing by creating a transparent, accessible, and decentralized platform that connects patients in need with compassionate donors worldwide. We aim to:

- **Break down barriers** to healthcare access by providing an alternative funding mechanism
- **Ensure transparency** through blockchain technology where all transactions are publicly verifiable
- **Eliminate intermediaries** and reduce fees, ensuring maximum funds reach patients
- **Create global accessibility** allowing anyone with internet access to seek or provide healthcare funding
- **Build trust** through smart contract automation and immutable transaction records

We envision a world where financial constraints never prevent someone from receiving necessary medical treatment.
